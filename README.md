# Auto-Packages-Installation

auto_installation.sh is a bash script that automates installation of packages that are commonly needed after each new ubuntu re-installation.
It is a simple script that you can use as it is, or edit it according to your favourite packages.

# Included Packages:
 - Google-Chrome (Stable Version).
 - Python3.6 (It is installed by default in recent ubuntu distros, but I like to make sure it is installed).
 - Pycharm IDE (Community Version).
 - R.
 - Rstudio.
 - Atom (Text-Editor).
